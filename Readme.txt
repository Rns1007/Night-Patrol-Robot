We have included all the files required to run this project.

The mobile app which only works on Android devices is also uploaded and can be used to control the Robot manually or through Voice control

To connect your own ESP32 Cam, connect the cam to wifi, not it's IP, and open the index.html file. Go to line 155 and replace the IP till :88 with your own ESP32 cam IP.

Connect the sensors, cross check the MQTT topic details in the index.html file if needed, open the html file on a local host and you can see all the data on the dashboard.

Regards.
